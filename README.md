<h1>Capstone Banking App</h1>

<h2>Description/Motivation</h2> <br>
This is the capstone assignment for the MIT full stack bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a banking app that included a navbar, pages such as create account, deposit, withdraw, balance, and all data. <br><br>

<h2>Installation Guidelines</h2> <br>
Git Clone, navigate to "client" folder, npm init, install the dependencies, and run "npm start"--I used craco (Create React App Configuration Override), so you should see craco compiling in the terminal as it starts. Then use "npm run build".

It took me several iterations to complete this in a working fashion. Unfortunately, I had to let go of the first version with the lovely animated gradient background, and something broke, and after a full weekend, I could not get it up and running again.

<h2>Technology Used</h2> <br>
The MERN stack, as well as Formik, Zustand, TailwindsCSS, Netlify, and AWS Lambda.

<h2>Features</h2> <br>
Responsive navbar, and functioning forms such as create account, login, and deposit. I would like to add/improve more authentication and security, as well as go much farther with the front-end UI. Getting the bare-bones working was a huge challenge, so I ran out of time with that aspect.
