<h2>Technology Used</h2> <br>
The MERN stack, as well as AWS Amplify, Firebase, Bootstrap, and a data abstraction layer.

<h2>Features</h2> <br>
Responsive navbar, animated gradient background, and functioning forms such as create account, login, and deposit. I would like to add/improve authentication and security, as well as make the card forms more responsive and centered.
